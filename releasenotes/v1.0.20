For Upgrading
DB: No database update is required if upgrading from v1.0.6 or newer. The current expected schema version is 20170726 or 20190225.
Server: If you are upgrading from v1.0.10 or newer, then perform a standard upgrade as follows
  yum upgrade object-drive-1.0-1.0.20b4-2987.20190402.x86_64.rpm
If you are upgrading from a version prior to v1.0.10, then changes to the versioning scheme in the package metadata will cause the above upgrade to fail for does not update installed package. You can force an update by using the rpm command as follows
  rpm --force --upgrade object-drive-1.0-1.0.20b4-2987.20190402.x86_64.rpm
