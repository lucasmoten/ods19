FIX: Database migrations run from rollup script 20170630 now use correct value for permission mac. Schema is now 20170726

For Upgrading
DB: The database schema requires an update with this release to 20170726. 
This update corrects permission signatures for those systems that were migrated 
using the rollup 20170630 script in a previous release. If you previously 
upgraded from any 1.0.1.x release to 1.0.2-1.0.5, this database update may 
take a few minutes, depending on the number of objects and permissions in the system. 
For most instances, including those previously affected, this should be a fast 
running update and can be safely run in the background. Refer to guidance for 
migrating the schema
