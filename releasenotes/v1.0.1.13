Commit: 2be3776237fee825ebccdfa301214c6828276cb2
Date:   January 30, 2017

ENH: Calculated full path and unique names for objects.
Slashes present when creating objects will be treated as path delimiters and create intermediate folders, if missing
Slashes are now restricted characters from updates.
Existing objects are transformed.
Objects whose names are prefixed with portion marks will also be broken up and treated as intermediate folders. Support for portion marking the name/title of an object is planned for a later release. If you must have this now, recommend using underscores in place of slashes
ENH: Bulk Delete objects: DELETE /objects
ENH: Bulk Move objects: POST /objects/move
FIX: Restore ability to update properties on objects
ENH: Bulk Change owner objects: POST /objects/owner/{resourceString}
ENH: Return properties in search results consistent with other list calls
ENH: Check database schema version on startup. Must match expected. Wait for migration before terminating.
NEW: Emit events with audit payload for all handlers to support ICS 500-27
NEW: Build Changelog into HTML and link from API Documentation


When the RPM is upgraded, the database tool should be run to update the schema to 20161230
